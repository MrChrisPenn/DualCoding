## Why 1,2,3?

+This is the first example of 1, 2, 3 coding cards. EduBlocks allows you to simply create Python code in a drag and drop environment. In this first exercise we will use Python to send a message to in game chat window. We will then create the exact same mod using Python 3 whuch is a text based programming language. 

Step 1: Grab a Pi.

Step 2: Master visual coding with EduBlocks.

Step 3: Learn how to create the same mod with text based code with Python 3.

## Getting started 

1. Open EduBlocks from the Desktop icon.
2. Click on the Minecraft coding tab on the left handside
